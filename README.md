# Graph-Algorithms-Data-Structures-
This repository contains a collection of graph algorithms and data structures implemented in multiple programming languages. The goal is to provide efficient and easy-to-understand implementations of classic graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and more.
# Key Features:

    * Graph Representation: Various ways to represent graphs, including adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and edge lists.
    * Core Algorithms: Implementations of graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.
    * Cycle Detection: Algorithms for detecting cycles in directed and undirected graphs.
    * Graph Visualization: Tools for visualizing graph structures and traversal processes (optional, if you have visualization tools).
# Languages & Technologies:

    *Python
    *JavaScript
    *Java
    *C++ .
