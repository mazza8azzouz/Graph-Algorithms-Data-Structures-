# Graph-Algorithms-Data-Structures-
This repository contains a collection of graph algorithms and data structures implemented in multiple programming languages. The goal is to provide efficient and easy-to-understand implementations of classic graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and more.
